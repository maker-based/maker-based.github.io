Yet, they are in low supply as less than 3% of college students and less than 1% high school students gain experience in computer science. If we don't improve the rate at which we teach our students then there will be an excess of 1 million jobs than qualified students by 2020. The reason, with the current resources available to schools coding is hard to learn and even harder to teach. We make it easy to learn and fun for you and your students to as they gain confidence and skills in this critical and growing career field. The result: Your students are the top of the field when applying to competitive colleges and even beyond, as they take that step towards the workforce.</p>
