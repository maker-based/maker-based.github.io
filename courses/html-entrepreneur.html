                  <h3>Designers who want to get better jobs and increase their salary</h3>
                  <p>Nowadays companies are looking for more than just a graphic designer. They’re looking for designers that can make their designs come to life on a webpage through HTML and CSS. Don’t take our word for it? Listen to our students:</p>
                  <p><em>Around two months ago I graduated from the University of Applied Sciences in Rotterdam as a User Experience Designer. Pretty awesome but soon I discovered there was not a lot of work in this area of expertise. So to enhance my chances for a suitable job I decided to improve my front-end skills. Every company wants people with programming skills nowadays. Since I advertised that in my motivational letters and mentioning it in my CV I have multiple invitation from companies to get to know each other."</em> -- Ruud Visser, Graduate from University of Applied Sciences in Rotterdam</p>
                  <h3>Coders that want to learn HTML and CSS fast</h3>
                  <p><em>Excellent course that exposed me step-by-step to the world of web design. I come from a computer programming background and never really had to build a site from scratch. This was a great tool in pushing me to be a more well-rounded tech person.</em> - Khalid</p>
                  <h3>Complete beginners</h3>
                  <p><strong>Absolutely awesome!</strong> <em>I recommend this course to anyone who feels like learning to code is too hard to start off with, because it really isn't. I thought it was too hard, but Ryan makes it look really easy with his step for step increase in difficulty. I built my own website within a week after starting this course, and it looks really great. Keep it up, Ryan!</em> -- Robert de Kok</p>
                  <h3>Those that have tried to learn HTML and CSS before and stopped</h3>
                  <p><em>This is the first time I was able to go from start to finish with making an entire site. I have done other training before but they don't ever seem to close it off at the end. This class went over everything needed to make a site. I would love to find other courses like this. I also did not feel dumb mid way through the course due to lack of explaining. Everything was well documented and covered. Very good job on this thanks.</em> - Jay Mims</p>
                  <h3>Hustlers who want promotions</h3>
                  <p><em>Man, I would have to say this is hands down the best course ever! I've done a ton of certifications, training, and real-world experience in other areas of IT. Nothing I've done so far has been as rewarding and I felt like making something and actually have the necessary skills to do so, without looking elsewhere. Thanks for this, I am at a loss for words; I hope this helped articulate how thankful I am. Thank you!</em> -- Cortell Shaw</p>

                  <h2>Reviews</h2>
                  <p><strong>Top-notch Developer Course!</strong> This course is well worth the price. If you like bootstrap you will learn everything you need to know here. Plenty of great html and css goodies. Thank you Ryan! You do a great job teaching the art of coding! - Ian Poston</p>
                  <p>I really like this course!!! I would rank this course in the top three of all courses that I've taken. Ryan is very knowledgeable and has keen insight on HTML and CSS. I also found the instructor easy to follow and understand. Gr8 course, Ryan. Keep up the AWESOME work my friend!!! - Pierre Pinkerton</p>
                  <p>I'll keep this concise and say that I can finally take a course and learn by doing it rather than sitting through hours of lecture and then trying to apply it after the fact. I'm a big proponent of show me what to do and let me do it. Going through this course has given me hope that I can do this for a living and love it. - Ronick</p>
                  <p>It's really good, short but it explains everything so everyone understands. It's good for complete beginners as well for web developers with some experience. Ryan goes straight to the point which is a big plus too... :) - Jaroslav Janik</p>
                  <p>The teacher is awesome, the course is extremely well prepared (the teacher knows how to present new topics), easy to learn, learning with examples. This course was much better than I could possibly imagine. Thanks Ryan Bonhardt! :D - Carlo Lucas</p>
                  <p>I thought the course was excellent. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about designing, css, html, and responsive websites. The course not only taught me what I was looking for but Ryan's course also gave me ideas of what I needed next. Ryan was very engaging and I would love to take more of his courses. - Suzanne</p>
                  <p>This course is perfect for anyone who want to learn HTML,CSS and Bootstrap. I like the way you teach,everything is easy to understand. Thank you ! This is my result : http://79.170.44.93/gabrielanedelcu.com/ - Gabriela Nedelcu</p>
                  <p><strong>A must for the self-taught designer!</strong> I am writing this review on the day I have completely finished this course. I took the course at my leisure so it took me a lot longer to complete but I completed it nonetheless. This review is for those who are thinking of taking this course but want to know exactly what they can expect to learn. First off, Mr. Bonhardt is an excellent teacher. The course is clearly labeled, laid out and very easy to follow. You will learn the ins and out's of the Twitter Bootstrap template, how to use Dropbox, Github, Sumome, Gumroad, FontAwesome and a ton of other little tasty tidbits of design knowledge that will elevate you from the ranks of amateur to being able to actual build sites that look professional. Why you should take this course: If you want to learn some of the newest techniques on how to put up a website fast, make it responsive so that it can be viewed on all sorts of screens, manipulate tools to quickly diagnose problems with existing sites and obtain a workable knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3, then take this course. You absolutely will not regret it. - Joe P</p>
                  <p>Ryan did a great job explaining different components and techniques to use css to create beautiful sites. What's most useful is the example and live demo he shows during the course. It makes me very easy to follow with deep impressions. - Chaoquin Liu Winston</p>
                  <p><strong>Possibly the best HTML/CSS course!</strong> Of the several HTML/CSS courses I've been working through, Ryan's easily ranks as one of the best. It isn't perfect, as nothing is perfect, but Ryan backs up his claim of truly understanding how one ought to teach. Anyone can be intimidated when learning new technologies, including me, and Ryan puts you at ease throughout the course. I completely agree that the way most other instructors try to each just isn't as helpful, or it has no relevance to what you would do in the real world. While at times with Ryan I felt that all I was doing was taking someone else's work (Bootstrap templates) and modifying them...I now grasp that there's no truly original website. All web sites have borrowed ideas. It's the content that makes them unique. Ryan has given me much hope that I can become a full-fledged web developer in the near future. I own a Wordpress blog that I've wished for a long time that I could redo myself, and I believe soon I will be able to. I also would like to help others revamp some of their websites, or help in general. Ultimately, I would love to make a career out of this, and move away from QA/automation. I would also love it if Ryan created courses on Javascript/jQuery and/or PHP, or perhaps even one on Wordpress development, since so many websites are now powered by that platform. While I imagine there is room in the industry for people who only do front-end development, you can go much further if you can tackle both sides of web development. Probably the only courses that rival this are authored by Brad Hussey. I've learned from both gentlemen, but just appreciate Ryan's style and candidness more. Thank you Ryan for all your hard work. I've learned a lot! - Justin Joseph</p>
                  <p><strong>Great, fast paced course</strong> I really enjoyed doing this course because it uses new technologies and the fast pace in it allows you to accomplish a lot of things very quickly, it doesn't get stuck explaining each and every HTML tag there is or so. I highly recommend taking it! - Jose Pablo Flores Garcia</p>
                  <p><strong>FANTASTIC! Would absolutely recommend</strong> Ryan provides many different avenues of web design in this course. I got the course on a bundle deal from Stack Social, and in the end would pay 10x plus more than I actually paid for it. So many things I learned and he covers a ton of ground. Ryan is also extremely accessible and quick to respond to issues. Definitely recommend this to anyone! - Steve Nuss</p>

                <p>Hi,</p>
                <p>I'm Ryan Bonhardt, the Founder of Maker-Based and the teacher for this course.</p>
                <p>The fact is that over 100,000 websites are being created every day. Websites are in higher demand than ever before.</p>
                <p>If you want to test a business idea quick... you need a website.</p>
                <p>If you want to start a blog and following online... you need a website.</p>
                <p>If you want to be a web freelancer and make $1,000s per project... you need to be able to build websites</p>
                <p>If you want to learn php, ruby on rails, python, or any other web development language...you guessed it, you need to know HTML and CSS and be able to build websites.</p>
                <p>You see the trend. And yet by 2020 there will be 1 million jobs in the US alone that will be unfilled because there aren’t you guys (and gals ;)) with the right skills to fill them.</p>
                <p>And I get it. There are so many resources out there and you don’t know which ones to choose. Some of them are just plain bad and some it seems like the instructors make it hard on purpose. Like it’s a secret piece of the pie they want all to themselves.</p>
                <p>I was there too. I tried teaching myself HTML and CSS multiple times just to quit and get frustrated. Then a couple months would pass and I’d get excited again. I’d startover, try to cram it all, get frustrated and quit again.  This repeated so many times I’m embarassed to admit it.</p>
                <p>But I’m not the only one. You may be in this exact situation right now.</p>
                <p>And it’s not all your fault.  The problem is that we’ve grown up trying to learn everything, like we’re cramming for a test before we start actually trying what we’ve learned. After all, we never want to fail a test right?</p>
                <p>Well we’re not going to do that in this course. In this course we’re going to start making websites from the very first day. And within a month you will have three beautiful websites you built yourself.</p>
                <p>We’re going to move fast, you’re going to stay excited, you're going to learn <strong>a lot</strong> and at the end you’re going to be blown away by how much you can do and know in such a short time.</p>
                <p>In less than one month from now you will know HTML and CSS and be able to build beautiful websites fast. If not then I will personally refund your money - every single penny. So come join me. Let’s learn start learning together.</p>
