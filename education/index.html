             <p class="text-just">Coding is one of the fastest growing industries right now and skills are in high demand with an average starting salary of almost $100,000. Yet, they are in low supply as less than 3% of college students and less than 1% high school students gain experience in computer science. If we don't improve the rate at which we teach our students then there will be an excess of 1 million jobs than qualified students by 2020. The reason, with the current resources available to schools coding is hard to learn and even harder to teach. We make it easy to learn and fun for you and your students to as they gain confidence and skills in this critical and growing career field. The result: Your students are the top of the field when applying to competitive colleges and even beyond, as they take that step towards the workforce.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-size:20px;">"The creativity that was sparked during the sessions left me amazed. You all were able to bring skills and talents out of the students that they did not know that they had. The websites that were created were absolutely amazing! For some of the students this experience affirmed what they already knew that they wanted to do in the future."</h3>

I've done a ton of certifications, training, and real-world experience in other areas of IT. Nothing I've done so far has been as rewarding and I felt like making something and actually have the necessary skills to do so, without looking elsewhere.Thanks for this, I am at a loss for words; I hope this helped articulate how thankful I am. Thank you!</h3>

Around two months ago I graduated from the University of Applied Sciences in Rotterdam as a User Experience Designer. Pretty awesome but soon I discover there was not a lot of work in this area of expertise. So to enhance my chances for a suitable job I decided to improve my front-end skills. Every company wants people with programming skills nowadays. Since I advertised that in my motivational letters and mentioning it in my CV I have multiple invitation from companies to get to know each other."</h3>
